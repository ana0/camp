# What is the NAME of your project?
IPFS and Ham Radio

# What DOES THE PROJECT DO/what will you SHOW?
An amateur radio, ad-hoc APRS network with RaspberryPis and Baofeng UV-82s. One Pi plus Baofeng will act as an APRS digital repeater (in the VHF band). One Pi plus RTL-SDR antenna will act as an APRS receiver, webserver, and an IPFS file server. Or something pretty close to this.

FAPRS - F# for APRS, a system I wrote to construct, schedule, and manage APRS messages.

The system will attempt to model an emergency communications system that uses Ham Broadband mesh networks and APRS VHF radio communications to distribute messages and share data.

# WHO will PRESENT the project?
Me, Marnee Dearman. Github handle MarneeDear.

# WHAT EQUIPMENT will you need?
1. Table 
2. Power strip for USA power with at least 6 sockets. I have one socket adapter, but I might need two
2. Monitor 
3. I need 4 shortish ethernet cables. 2+ feet should be ok.
4. I will provide all other equipmen: 2 WIFI radios, one VHF radio, 2 Pi 3s, one RTL-SDR antenna, all the power cables for the equipment.

# Any other QUESTIONS or SUGGESTIONS?
If I bring a second radio or a set of walkie talkies, my demo can be very interactive. I might be able to do this.

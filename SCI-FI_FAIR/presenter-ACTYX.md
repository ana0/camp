# What is the NAME of your project?
Actyx

# What DOES THE PROJECT DO/what will you SHOW?
Production data acquisition and training video delivery over IPFS, mirroring live data from a factory. Shown on a nearly indestructible industrial tablet!

# WHO will PRESENT the project?
RÃ¼diger Klaehn (@klaehnr)

# WHAT EQUIPMENT will you need?
Mount for the tablet. The tablet cradle has holes for a 75mm x 75mm VESA mount. Also, a power outlet would be very useful.

Is there space for a poster with some explanation and some action shots, for when I am not personally present to explain things?

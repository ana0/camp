# IPFS for websites (static, dynamic, search, etc)

Basic publishing on IPFS is dead simple! But many traditional workflows on the centralized web are not at all straightforward.

Additionally, traditional search engines will not work the same, either in a technology nor a business sense.

If a website is published in a merkle forest and no one is around to read it, is its information truly free?

Let's dive deeply into understanding the challenges for traditional web developers and publishers in moving to IPFS. Let's define some best-practices, helpful workflows, tools and resources for Busy Web Developers.

## Goal

Some possible goals...

* We'll have identified a set of primary use-cases for publishing websites with IPFS
* We'll have a set of recommended workflows and tools for meeting those use-cases
* We'll understand and be able to describe the trade-offs (pros and cons)
* We'll know what the biggest roadblocks are, so we can know what to work on next
* We'll know what the biggest misconceptions are, so we can educate people about them
* We'll know what higher-level workflows and patterns are needed to bridge the gap with traditional web development
* We'll identify where we can integrate into existing tools, IDEs, servers for easing adoption

## Requirements to consider

Some possible requirements...

* Websites need to stay up
* People need names not hashes
* A vibrant web has dynamic content
* Search is the most powerful content discovery tool in the history of the internet
